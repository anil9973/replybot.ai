✅ Personalized AI-powered auto-reply

ReplyBot analyzes chat history, business details, documentation, and even scrapes web content to automatically send tailored replies when customers message you. There's no need to manually visit specific customer webpages; simply input the URL pattern, and ReplyBot will extract the relevant data for you—completely automated.

✅ Automatic message translation
When a customer messages, ReplyBot automatically detects the language, translates the message, and displays the translation alongside the original text. You don't need to worry about crafting replies in the customer's language—just write your response, and ReplyBot will auto-translate it before sending.

✅ Built-in chat summarizer
No more wasting time scrolling through long chat histories. ReplyBot summarizes conversations, saving you valuable time and effort.

✅ Advanced Web Content Scraping via URL Patterns

Example: When a customer asks, "Where's my order?", you currently need to open a new tab, enter the tracking details, and manually update the customer on their shipment status. But why do this manually when ReplyBot can handle it automatically?

Simply create a URL pattern, and ReplyBot will take care of the rest.

**URL Pattern Example:**  
For the tracking URL `https://track.amazon.com/tracking/6654546454`, the pattern would be:  
`https://track.amazon.com/tracking/[[AWB,ask_agent]]`, or
`https://track.amazon.com/tracking/[[AWB,ask_customer]]`

ReplyBot automatically looks for the AWB (tracking number) in the chat history. If it's not found, it will prompt either the customer or the agent for the details, ensuring a seamless, automated response.

✅ Pop-up window for all unread messages
No need to switch to WhatsApp to check unread messages or respond to customers. ReplyBot displays all unread messages (not just the latest) in a convenient pop-up window. You can even reply directly from the pop-up. Simply press Alt+U to view unread messages from any tab.

🚧 Caveat:
Currently, ReplyBot cannot switch between open chats automatically—you'll need to do this manually for now. However, I'm actively working on a solution to improve this feature.
